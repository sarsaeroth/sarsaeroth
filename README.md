- Hi, I’m Peter Clark. I am currently a Member of Technical Staff at Sandia National Laboratories, as well as a PhD student at Iowa State University in Computer Engineering with a focus on Secure and Reliable Computing.
- I’m interested in cybersecurity. My general background is in analysis of distributed cryptographic systems, such as Bitcoin and Tor. More specifically, my interest has been in the analysis of proxy networks. 
- I'm currently working on teaching myself more offensive security principles, from general red teaming to more in-depth exploit development with a particular interest in kernel-level vulnerabilities.
- Please reach out if there's any projects that you think I would be interested in collaborating on.
- The best way to reach me for issues/collaboration is through pgclark @ iastate [.] edu
- Fun fact: My interest in programming started when I became interested in learning how to write WeiDU mods for Baldur's Gate 2.
- The projects on this repository largely fall into two camps:
  - Python libraries for scientific computing. My undergraduate background is in mathematics and physics, and I occasionally have an interest in software development for non-security related purposes.
    - [PyHF](https://github.com/sarsaeroth/PyHF) - Python library for numerical computation of Hartree-Fock configurations in quantum mechanics.
    - [PyIsing](https://github.com/sarsaeroth/PyIsing) - Python library for adiabatic simulation of Ising spin glasses for certain NP-complete problems. Developed as a term project for COMS 5340.
    - [PyPansophy](https://github.com/sarsaeroth/PyPansophy) - Python library for calculation of pansophy (expected number of disjoint paths) of a graph. Based off of the dissertation work of a friend.
    - [PySL](https://github.com/sarsaeroth/PySL) - Python library for numerical calculation of solutions to Sturm-Liouville-type differential equations.
  - Security and vulnerability research. These will be written primarily, but not necessarily, in C/C++ to develop my coding skills in those environments. They will be focused on reverse engineering of exploits, especially based on the Linux and Windows kernels.
    - [CVE-2023-23397](https://github.com/sarsaeroth/CVE-2023-23397-POC) - POC for an Outlook zero-click vulnerability allowing retrieval and cracking of NTLM credentials.
    - [CVE-2023-41064](https://github.com/sarsaeroth/CVE-2023-41064-POC) - POC for an Apple ImageI/O zero-click vulnerability allowing for remote code execution.
    - [CVE-2023-4863](https://github.com/sarsaeroth/CVE-2023-4863-POC) - POC for a libwebp zero-click vulnerability based on Huffman tables allowing for remote code execution.
    - [FPGAcrypto](https://github.com/sarsaeroth/FPGAcrypto) - Library for simulating side-channel analysis of cryptographic algorithms in Verilog. Developed as a term project for CPRE5810.
    - [MimiGhostz](https://github.com/sarsaeroth/MimiGhostz) - A version of Mimikatz that uses speculative execution to read the memory of a target process to grab credentials. Developed as a term project for CPRE 6810.
